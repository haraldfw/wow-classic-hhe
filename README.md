# TODO
* Generate link so user can check if a spell is already reported (or even closed)
* Paladin support
* Resto druid support
* Dropdown or input field to let user choose how much to scale group-heals
* Allow hiding of specific spells or types of spells(HoTs, group heals, with/without casting time)
* Allow to "save" spells so they still show up with their latest previously known state even if they are no longer in the spell book. This is to be able to compare rune-spells that require the same rune slot, e.g. Circle of Healing and Penance.
